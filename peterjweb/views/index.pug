              I'm a web designer and developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. More commonly known as Silicon Valley. I have a passion for both web design and development and love to create fast responsive websites for all screen sizes and types.

              Born in the U.K. in a town called Swindon <span class="myAge"></span> years ago, however I have now lived in california for <span class="residence"></span> years.

              Me and my wife recently welcomed our first child into the world, and are overjoyed. In my ever decreasing spare time I enjoy watching and playing football (soccer), the odd video game here and there and listening to music way too loud on my headphones.

              I have been very fortunate to grow up in Silicon Valley in and around some of the greatest Developers and Designers in the world. Along the way I have picked up a few tips and tricks myself. I'm always looking to expand on what I already know, and enjoy looking to the future of the industry and what it will bring.
            p.
              My main focus is Front End web development, although I have a solid grounding in design. I enjouy working on UX/UI as it bridges both Design and Development and allows me to showcase my creativity and talents.
